# Pandects Privacy Policy

Effective date: **December 21, 2025**

> **In short**
> - We use cookies for authentication, security, and site analytics.
> - We use Google Analytics and basic client-side error telemetry.
> - We do not sell personal information.

Pandects is an open-source M&A research platform. We pull text from public filings on the SEC’s EDGAR system, parse it, use AI to tag and classify it, and make the resulting structured data available on this site and (in some cases) as downloadable datasets.

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect when you use Pandects (the “Service”), how we use it, and the choices you may have.

If you have questions about this policy, contact us at **nmbogdan@alumni.stanford.edu**.

## 1. Who We Are

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Pandects,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the operators and maintainers of the Service. The Service may be operated by individuals or through one or more entities.

## 2. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect through:

- The Pandects website and related web pages (including `/about`, `/terms`, and `/privacy-policy`)
- The Pandects API and related endpoints
- Feedback, survey, or contact forms embedded on the site (including third-party forms)

This policy does not apply to third-party websites, services, or platforms that may be linked from Pandects (for example, GitHub, Airtable, Google, hosting providers, or the SEC’s EDGAR system). Their data practices are governed by their own privacy policies, and we are not responsible for them.

## 3. Information We Collect

### A. Information you provide

Depending on how you use the Service, you may provide:

- **Account information:** such as your email address. If password authentication is enabled, passwords are stored only as a cryptographic hash.
- **Feedback and survey responses:** information you submit via embedded forms (for example, Airtable forms). The content depends on the form.
- **Communications:** information you include when you email us or contact us through other channels.

You are responsible for ensuring that information you submit does not include sensitive personal information unless you intend to provide it.

### B. Information collected automatically

When you use the Service, we and our service providers may collect:

- **Access and server logs:** IP address, request timestamps, requested URLs, HTTP status codes, user agent strings, and referrer information, used to operate, secure, debug, and audit the Service.
- **Analytics data:** usage and interaction data collected via Google Analytics (see below).
- **Session and security data:** cookies or similar identifiers used for session management, authentication, and CSRF protection.
- **API usage data:** if you use an API key, we collect request counts, timestamps, and key metadata. API keys are stored only as a cryptographic hash, along with a short prefix to help you identify a key.

### C. Cookies and similar technologies

Pandects uses cookies and similar technologies for:

- **Authentication and security:** maintaining sessions (where enabled) and protecting requests.
- **Analytics:** measuring usage and performance via Google Analytics.

You can control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may affect certain features or functionality.

### D. Analytics and error telemetry (Google Analytics)

The Service uses Google Analytics (via `gtag.js`). Google Analytics may collect information such as your browser type, device characteristics, approximate geographic location, and usage patterns, and may process your IP address as part of providing analytics services.

Pandects also sends limited client-side error telemetry (for example, JavaScript error messages and file or line references) to Google Analytics to help diagnose issues and improve reliability. **Do not submit sensitive or confidential information in places where it could be captured in an error message.**

For more information about Google’s data practices, see Google’s privacy materials.

## 4. How We Use Information

We use information we collect to:

- **Provide and operate** the Service, including authentication, API access, and dataset distribution.
- **Maintain security and integrity**, including preventing abuse, enforcing rate limits, and investigating suspicious activity.
- **Measure, analyze, and improve** the Service, including debugging, analytics, and performance monitoring.
- **Communicate with you**, including responding to inquiries, feedback, or support requests.

We do not use personal information to make automated decisions that produce legal or similarly significant effects.

## 5. How We Share Information

We do not sell personal information.

We may share information in the following circumstances:

- **Service providers:** with vendors that help us operate the Service (such as hosting providers, analytics providers, authentication services, and form providers). These providers process information on our behalf under their own terms and privacy policies.
- **Legal and safety reasons:** to comply with applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request, or to protect the rights, safety, and security of Pandects, our users, or the public.
- **Business changes:** if the Service is reorganized, transferred, or acquired (for example, through a merger, acquisition, or asset sale), information may be transferred as part of that transaction.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain information for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes described in this policy, including to operate the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.

Examples:

- **Account information** is retained until you request deletion, subject to legal and operational requirements.
- **API usage and security logs** may be retained to prevent abuse, enforce rate limits, and maintain system integrity.
- **Analytics and telemetry data** are retained according to operational needs and the retention settings of our service providers.

We may retain information in aggregated or anonymized form for longer periods.

## 7. Your Choices and Rights

Depending on your location and how you use the Service, you may have the right to:

- Request access to, correction of, or deletion of your account information.
- Request deactivation of your account and revocation of API keys.
- Opt out of certain analytics by disabling cookies or using browser or device controls.

To make a request, contact **nmbogdan@alumni.stanford.edu**. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests, and some requests may be subject to legal or operational limitations.

## 8. Security

We take reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information. However, no system is completely secure. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and API keys.

## 9. Children

The Service is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required by applicable law), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date and, where appropriate, provide additional notice. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
