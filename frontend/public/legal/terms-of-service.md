# Pandects Terms of Service

Effective date: **December 21, 2025**

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Pandects (the “Service”). Pandects is an open-source M&A research platform that gathers text from public filings on the SEC’s EDGAR system, parses it, uses AI to tag and classify it, and makes the resulting structured data available on this site and (in some cases) as downloadable datasets.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms. **If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you accept these Terms for that organization and represent and warrant that you have authority to bind it.** If you do not agree, do not use the Service.

Questions about these Terms can be sent to **nmbogdan@alumni.stanford.edu**.

## 1. Who We Are

“Pandects,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the operators and maintainers of the Service. **The Service may be operated by individuals or through one or more entities.**

## 2. Changes to the Service or Terms

We may change the Service (including features, APIs, datasets, models, pricing, rate limits, or availability) at any time. We may also update these Terms. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date and, where appropriate, provide notice.

**Your continued use of the Service after updated Terms become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.**

## 3. Eligibility

You must be able to form a binding contract with us to use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.

The Service is not directed to children. You may not use the Service if you are under 18 years of age (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction).

## 4. Accounts, Authentication, and API Keys

Some features may require an account or API key.

- **Account information:** You must provide accurate information and keep it up to date. You may not impersonate another person or misrepresent your affiliation.
- **Security:** You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and API keys and for all activity that occurs under them.
- **API keys:** We may impose or modify rate limits and quotas, revoke keys we believe are compromised or misused, and block or throttle requests to protect the Service or other users.

## 5. Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Service lawfully and responsibly. You will not:

- Interfere with or disrupt the Service, including by probing, scanning, testing vulnerabilities, or degrading performance.
- Circumvent or attempt to circumvent rate limits, access controls, authentication, or security features.
- Access the Service using automated means in violation of these Terms or applicable law.
- Use data obtained from the Service to develop, train, or improve models in violation of rights or restrictions applicable to the underlying materials.
- Misrepresent the Service or the origin of data, or remove attribution, provenance, or notices.
- Reverse engineer or attempt to extract source code from non–open-source components except as permitted by law.
- Use the Service to violate law, infringe rights, or distribute malware or harmful code.
- Suggest endorsement by Pandects without our prior written consent.

We may monitor, investigate, and take action for suspected violations, including suspension or termination, without notice where appropriate.

## 6. Data Sources, Outputs, and Accuracy Disclaimers

### A. Public sources

The Service includes content derived from public filings and other public sources. We do not control and are not responsible for the completeness, accuracy, or availability of those sources.

### B. AI processing and errors

We use automated methods, including AI systems, to parse, tag, and classify text. Outputs may be incomplete, inaccurate, or change over time. **You are responsible for independently verifying results before relying on them.**

### C. No professional advice

The Service and any outputs are provided for research and informational purposes only and do not constitute legal, financial, investment, or other professional advice.

## 7. Intellectual Property

### A. Service software

Pandects is open-source. The source code is licensed as described in the repository’s license file (currently GNU GPLv3, unless otherwise noted). Nothing in these Terms limits your rights under that license. Except for open-source components, we reserve all rights in the Service.

### B. Third-party materials

Underlying agreements and documents originate from third parties. Rights remain with their respective owners. Pandects does not claim ownership of those materials.

### C. Datasets and derived outputs

Derived datasets may be provided for download or API access. **The dataset license is described at: [link or file path]** and may differ from the software license. If no dataset license is provided, contact us before using datasets beyond personal or academic research.

We may modify, suspend, or discontinue datasets or APIs at any time.

### D. Takedown requests

If you believe content infringes your rights or should not be displayed, contact **nmbogdan@alumni.stanford.edu** with sufficient detail. We may remove or restrict access and may preserve or disclose information as required by law.

## 8. Third-Party Services

The Service may integrate or link to third-party services. Your use of those services is governed by their terms, not ours. We are not responsible for third-party services.

## 9. Termination

We may suspend or terminate access to the Service or API keys at any time for violation of these Terms, legal compliance, or to protect the Service or others. You may stop using the Service at any time.

Sections intended to survive termination—including disclaimers, limitations of liability, indemnification, and dispute resolution—will survive.

## 10. Disclaimers

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR THAT OUTPUTS WILL BE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE.

## 11. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL PANDECTS OR ITS OPERATORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED **USD $100**, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations. These limitations apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 12. Indemnification

To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Pandects and its operators from claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of law or third-party rights.

We may assume exclusive control of the defense of any indemnified matter.

## 13. Arbitration and Class Action Waiver

### A. Binding arbitration

Except as described below, any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved by **binding arbitration** administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules.

Arbitration will be conducted on an individual basis. **You and Pandects waive any right to a jury trial.**

### B. Class action waiver

To the maximum extent permitted by law, **you agree that disputes may be brought only in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, collective, or representative action.**

### C. Injunctive relief

Either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in court to prevent unauthorized use, misuse, or infringement of intellectual property or security-related harms.

### D. Consumer fallback

If you are a consumer and applicable law does not permit mandatory arbitration or the class action waiver for a particular claim, that claim may be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction, and the remainder of this Section 13 will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted.

## 14. Governing Law and Venue

These Terms are governed by the laws of the **State of Delaware**, excluding its conflict of law rules.

Any court proceedings (if permitted under Section 13) shall be brought **exclusively** in the state or federal courts located within the **State of Delaware**, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and venue and waive any objection based on inconvenient forum.

**Consumer fallback:** If applicable law does not permit exclusive Delaware venue for a consumer dispute, the dispute may be brought in the courts of the consumer’s state of residence.

## 15. Miscellaneous

- **Entire agreement:** These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Pandects regarding the Service.
- **Severability:** If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force.
- **Assignment:** You may not assign these Terms without our consent. We may assign them freely.
- **No waiver:** Failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver.
- **Force majeure:** We are not liable for delays or failures caused by events beyond our reasonable control.
