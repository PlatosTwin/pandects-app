    Effective Time. Nothing contained in this Section 2.5(a) shall require HCC to offer or sell shares of HCC common stock upon the exercise of options assumed by HCC hereunder if, in the reasonable judgment of HCC or its counsel, such offer or sale would not be in accordance with the applicable federal or state securities laws, provided that HCC shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions, if any, as are necessary for such offer or sale to be in accordance with such laws, including without limitation the filing with the SEC within 45 days following the Effective Time of a registration statement on Form S-8 under the 1933 Act covering the shares of HCC common stock issuable upon exercise of options assumed hereunder by HCC.

    (b) If on or before the Effective Time (i) the issued and outstanding shares of HCC common stock are changed into a different number of shares by reason of any recapitalization, stock split or stock dividend, then the number of shares of HCC common stock issuable upon exercise of VCI options assumed and converted pursuant to Section 2.5(a) above shall be correspondingly adjusted to that number and class of shares of common stock of HCC, if such options had been converted into options to acquire HCC common stock immediately before such recapitalization, stock split or stock dividend and the exercise price thereof shall be correspondingly adjusted; or (ii) there shall be a merger, share exchange or consolidation of HCC with or into another corporation or entity, then, as part of such merger, share exchange or consolidation, the VCI options to be assumed and converted pursuant to Section 2.3(a) above shall be equitably converted into options to acquire that number and class of shares of stock of the surviving corporation resulting from such merger or consolidation or the acquiring corporation in such share exchange, as if such VCI options had been converted into options to acquire HCC shares of common stock immediately prior to such merger, share exchange or consolidation, and the exercise price thereof shall be correspondingly and equitably adjusted.

    2.6 Exchange of Certificates.

    (a) Prior to the Closing Date, HCC shall appoint U.S. Stock Transfer Corporation to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger.

    (b) Promptly after the Closing Date, but in no event later than three business days thereafter, HCC shall give instructions to the Exchange Agent to make available within three business days thereafter for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.6, the shares of HCC common stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.3 in exchange for outstanding shares of capital stock of VCI, subject to the issuance of 10% of the shares of HCC common stock issuable to the Holders into escrow pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof.

    (c) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each Holder of record of a stock certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding shares of capital stock of VCI (a "Certificate"), whose shares are being converted into HCC common stock pursuant to Section 2.3, (i) a letter of transmittal … and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates evidencing HCC common stock.

    (d) No dividends or distributions payable to holders of record of HCC common stock after the Effective Time, or cash payable in lieu of fractional shares, shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the Holder of the Certificate shall surrender such Certificate.

    SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933.

    The legends contained in this Section 6.14(g) shall be removed from a certificate in connection with any sale in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement or a registration statement covered by Section 6.14(b), or pursuant to Rule 144 (if accompanied by any legal opinion reasonably required by the HCC), but shall not be removed in any other circumstance without HCC's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be granted if such legend is no longer appropriate).

    (h) Rule 144 Reporting. With a view to making available the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which may at any time permit the sale of the Registrable Securities to the public without registration, HCC agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to:

    (i) Make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times after the Merger;

    (ii) File with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of HCC under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and

    (iii) So long as a Holder owns any Registrable Securities, to furnish to that Holder forthwith upon request a written statement by HCC as to its compliance with the reporting requirements of said Rule 144, and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of HCC, and such other reports and documents of HCC as such Holder may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing such Holder to sell any such Registrable Securities without registration.

    6.15 Tax Matters.

    (a) HCC shall cause to be prepared and filed any required Tax Returns due to be filed by VCI or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date. The Stockholder Representative shall be responsible for preparation and filing of Tax Returns of Vitamins.com, LLC for its final taxable year ended August 15, 1999. HCC shall timely pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown to be due on such Tax Returns, without prejudice to any right to indemnity which the HCC Parties may have pursuant to Section 9.2 of this Agreement with respect to such Taxes.

    (b) For each Tax Return that HCC shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) with respect to VCI or any Subsidiary for any taxable period which includes any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, HCC shall, not less than 30 days prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is required to be filed, provide a copy of such Tax Return to the Stockholder Representative for comment and review. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right to direct HCC to adopt any filing position in such Tax Return if (i) such position is supported by a "more likely than not" opinion of reputable tax counsel and (ii) the reporting position initially proposed by HCC on such Tax Return would result in Holders' liability for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof. HCC shall cause all such Tax Returns to be prepared in a manner consistent with the methodology of VCI and its Subsidiaries used in prior taxable years, except as otherwise required by applicable law or regulations.

    (c) HCC shall not file, nor cause to be filed, on behalf of VCI or any Subsidiary any amended Tax Return with respect to a taxable period (or portion of a period) ending on or prior to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless (i) HCC agrees to release the Holders from liability for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 hereof, if any, which results from such amended Tax Return, or (ii) such amendment is compelled by the relevant taxing authority.

    (d) HCC and VCI and the Stockholder Representative agree to cooperate with one another in the preparation of any Tax Return pursuant to this Section 6.15 and amendment of any Tax Return for periods
